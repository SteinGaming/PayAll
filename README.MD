# PayAll
This is a minecraft mod, with which you're able to pay everyone on the server. <br>
I made this out of boredom while watching a YouTube video from DuperTrooper, in which he paid everyone manually. <br>
He replied to someone in the comments, who asked why he doesn't use a mod to automate it, that he doesn't have a ***competent*** developer to do that, and i just tried to do that.

## Building
<hr>
Minecraft mods have a tendency to be ratted, which is why I have the code public, with which everyone can check the code for any rats and build it for themselves. <br>
Just having the src public isn't enough, so I'm not making any own releases for them.

TODO I need links man I haven't pushed this yet
